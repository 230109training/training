# Welcome to 230109 Serverless NERD (Node.js, Express.js, React, DynamoDB)!
This is the training repository for the Serverless NERD cohort starting on January 9th, 2023. All of the notes, demos, study guides, project guidelines, and other resources will be found here.

## Training Recaps
* Documents containing recaps of what was covered for a particular week will be listed here

| Week | Topics Covered | Link |

## Weekly Expectations
* Training starts at 10:00 AM EST and ends at 6:00 PM EST everyday
    - You are expected to be on time each day. You may miss important information if you are not
* Lunch breaks occur each day at 1:00 PM EST to 2:00 PM EST

## Evaluations
* There will be a weekly quiz that tests the previous week's topics
* One-on-ones (or sometimes group interviews to save additional time) will take place at the beginning of each week
* QC will be conducted each week over prior weeks' topics (usually the content covered the week before or a couple of weeks before)

> One-on-ones are similar to QC in many ways as both are verbal evaluations to see how well you understand the material. However, the difference is that one-on-ones are a way for the trainer to understand your performance, while QC is a "third-party" evaluation by the QC team to make sure you are progressing according to Revature standards
