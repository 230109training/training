# Unit Testing

Unit testing is a software rtesting method where individual componets or units of a software application are tested in isolation from the rest of the application. The goal of unit testing is to validate that each unit of the software application is working as intended.
Unit tests are typically written by the developers as they work on the their code, the process is usually automated as well. This allows developers to quickly and easliy verify that the changes they make to the code do not break existing functionality.
Unit tests also help to identify and fix bugs in the development process, before they become a problem in the final product.

## What is a Unit Test

Usually, developers write unit tests first, then they write the software code. This approach is known as TDD (Test Driven Development). In TDD, the requirements are specified with test cases, then the software is developed or improved to pass these test vases. 
It is important that the test cases work in isolation to each other, to verify that each unit works in isolation. 

### Benefits
- Unit tests help to find and fix bugs quickly and easily
- Unit tests contribute to higher code quality
- Unit tests contribute to better application architecture
- Unit tests act as documentation
