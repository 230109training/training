# Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that helps teams create high-quality software in the shortest possible production time. The goal is to match the clients demand to the developers work, in order to create the best possible product for them.
SDLC defiens and outlines a detailed plan with stages, phases, that encompass their own process and deliverables.

 ## Why is it important?

 - It provides a standardized framework that defines activites and deliverables
 - It aids in project planning, estimating, and scheduling
 - It makes projects easier to track and control
 - It increases visibility on all aspects of the life cycle to all stakeholders
 - It increases the speed of development
 - It improves client relationships
 - It decreases project risk
 - It decreases project management expenses

 ## How does it work?

 ### Planning Phase

 The planning phase encompasses all aspects of project and product management. This typically includes resource allocation, capacity planning, project scheduling, cost estimation, and provisioning.

 During the palnning phase, the development team collects information from the stakeholders involved in the project. This includes: customers, sales, internal and external experts, and developers. The inputs are then syntehsized into a detailed requirements for the desired software.

 Expectations are clearly defined during this stage as well

 ### Coding Phase

 The coding phase includes system design in an IDE. It also includes static code analysis and code review on multiple devices

 ### Building Phase

 The building phase takes the code requirements determined earlier and uses those to begin actually building the software

 ### Testing Phase

 The phase usually occurs during or after the building phase depending on how the team has decided to approach the project. The testing team evaluates the developed product in order to assess whether they meet the requirements specified in the planning phase.

 Assessments can include: Functional Testing, Unit Testing, Code Quality Testing, Integration Testing, System Testing, Security Testing, Performance Testing and Acceptance Testing.

 ### Release Phase

 The release phase involves the team packaging, managing, and deploying releases across different environments

 ### Deploy Phase

 In this phase, the software is officially released into the production environment

 ### Operate Phase

 The operate phase is where the software is used in the production environment

 ### Monitor Phase

 Various elements of the software is monitored in order to evaluate different things like system performance, user experience, new security vulnerabilities, analysis of bugs or errors in the system

## What are the SDLC Methodologies

### Waterfall

This is the oldest and simplest, most structured methodology. Eahc phase depends on the outcome of the previous phase, and all phases are run sequentially. The name comes from the idea that each phase of the project should flow naturally and seamlessly into the next, like a waterfall.

The Waterfall methodology is strict and follows a close adherence to a pre-defined plan and a rigid sequence of steps. The process starts with the requirements gathering and analysis, followed by design, implementation, testing, and deployment. Each phase must be completed before moving on to the next, and changes are difficult to implement once a phase is completed.

Typically, waterfall is used when projects have well defined requirements, clear objectives, and a fixed scope. As it is inflexible, it does not benefit at all from any kind of uncertainty or frequent changes.

It is linear approach to SDLC, and has a few advantages and disadvantages.

Advantages:

- Clear and well-defined process: The waterfall methodology has a clear and well-defined process, which makes it easy for teams to understand and follow. This can be especially beneficial for projects that have a large number of stakeholders and for teams that are new to software development.
- Good for projects with clear objectives and fixed scope: This is because it is based on a linear, sequential approach to development, which allows for teams to plan and execute each step in the project step by step.
- Easy to measure progress: As it is linear and sequential, it is easy to measure progress at each stage of the project. This is especially useful for management and for showing stakeholders information on the project progress.

Disadvantages:

- Inflexible: Once a phase of the project is completed, it is difficult to go back and make changes. THis can lead to delays, cost overruns, and a final product that does not meet the needs of the customer
- Difficulty in accommodating requirements: As it is based on a linear approach, it can be difficult to appy to projects that are complex or have poorly defined requirements. Especially for those that require the requirements to be understood at the beginning of the project.
- Not adaptable to frequent changes: Linear phases in development that are difficult to reverse, and so any new changes to the requirements or in client demand will be hard to implement

### Projects that could use it?
- Governemnt Projects
- Military Projects
- Banking or Health projects


### Agile

Agile is a software development methodology that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and rapid iteration. It is based on the Agile Manifesto, a set of principles for software development that prioritize indiviudals and interaction, working software, and customer collaboration over processes and tools.

Agile is an iterative process, meaning that the process of building software is repeated multiple times, with each iteration building on the previous one. THis allow for more flexibility in the development process and helps to ensure the final product meets the needs of the customer.

One of the key practices in Agile development is the use of cross-functional teams. This means that team members have a variety of skills and expertise, and are able to work together to deliver the final product. This helps ensure that all aspects of the project is covered, and if in a particular feature there is difficulty then other teams can be brought in easlily with Agile.

Other Agile methodologies:
- Kanban : focus on visualizing work, limiting work-in-progress, and making process policies explicit
- XP (Extreme Programming): Focus on software development process, including coding, testing, and design
- Lean: Focus on maximizing efficiency and minimizing waste

Advantages

- Flexibility: It is an iterative process, which means it allows for more flexibility in the development process. The team can adapt to changes and uncertainty to deliver a better product for the customer
- Faster Delivery: The goal of agile is to deliver software quickly and frequently. We want to get as much feedback from the client and having working code to show them is the best way to do that and adapt to any changes need.
- Improved Collaboration: Agile emphasizes collaboration between team members, which leads to improved communication and a better final product.
- Improved Customer Satisfaction: Agiles goal is to deliver value to the customer in a timely manner.

Disdvantages

- More difficulty in planning and budget: Due to the iterative process, it can be difficult to predict the changes that could happen and to make a plan before even starting
- Requires Experienced Team members: Agile needs experienced team members who are able to manage the teams and adapt to frequent changes
- Challenging for large projects: Agile is better suited for small to medium-size projects, due to its iterative process it can be challenging to implement a larger project with many stakeholders
- Difficult to measure progress: As it is iterative there is no clear indication on progress, especially if changes require the process to be restarted
