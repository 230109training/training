# Jest Exercise 2 (Using Matcher)

## Description

This exercise involves using Jest's matchers to test a function called `isPositive` for different input values. This exercise will involve following TDD (Test Driven Development) in which the tests should be completed first, and then the function should be generated to pass the tests.

## Approach

1. Write test cases using Jest's matchers to check the output of the isPositive function for different input values, including positive, negative, and zero values.
2. Use Jest's test and expect functions to define the test cases and check the function's output using matchers.
3. Write a function called isPositive that takes a single argument, num, and returns a boolean indicating whether the number is positive or not.

## Hints

1. Use Jest's matchers, such as `toBe` and `not`, to check the output of the `isPositive` function.
2. Write test cases to check the function's behavior when passed positive, negative, and zero input numbers.
3. Use Jest's `expect` function to chain multiple matchers together.

## Deliverables

1. A working `isPositive` function that correctly returns whether the input value is positive or not
2. A set of test cases using Jest's matchers to verify the output of the isPositive function for different input values
3. A loom recording titled `Jest Exercise 2 (Using Matcher) firstName lastName`

        - Be centered on the camera
        - Look into the camera, not at the screen

        - This should be professionally presented
            - You do not need to wear professional clothes
    - Introduce what you have done
    - Explain how you approached it, and why you chose the decisions you did
    - Talk about what you used in the exercise (React features) and why
    - Provide a simple walkthrough, with first a demonstration of the component and then an explanation of its code
        - In the explanation, use technical keywords as much as possible instead of just descriptions
