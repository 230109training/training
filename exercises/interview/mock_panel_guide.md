# Mock Panel Guide

## Intro

Panel interviews can be nerve wracking, but with the right preparation, you can excel in them. In order to prepare, one of the more effective methods is going through mock interviews. While one-on-one style interviews can improve your performance in interviews, in order to excel in panel style interviews, you need to have experienced them. You will be organized into random groups, and from those groups you will be interviewing each other and assigning a grade from 0 - 10 on 4 metrics (without telling the interviewee):

1. Technical
2. Problem Solving Ability
3. Communication
4. Attitude

The rubric can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12_miXsfut6QOVJi8CeSPG4bL6hcGzGyIun3XrPdhmWc/edit?usp=sharing). Please read through it to have a good sense of what you need to be looking for when grading each other. Once you are familiar with the grading rubric, you will be ready to participate in the mock panels.

## Panel Preparation

1. Define the Roles
    - Determine who will play the roles of the interviewee and the interviewer
    - The roles will be moved around so don't focus on this step for too long
2. Prepare Questions
    - Each interviewer should assume the role of a member of the company and a manager of a different team
    - As each respective manager will need different skills, each interviewer must prepare a different set of questions to each other based on their requirements
    - The interviewers should make sure the questions are relevant to the job they need
    - Remember to not just use the questions in the question bank, make sure to make your own for what you feel is relevant
        - Some points to look out for are the interviewees skills, experiences, personality, etc.
3. Practice
    - Each interviewee should spend a few minutes just practicing with themselves either on camera or not
    - Run through a set of questions and practicing answering them
    - Make sure to feel comfortable before beginning, this is an essential part and needs to be used

## Conducting the Interview

1. Begin the Mock Interview
    - Interviewers should introduce themselves and provide a brief explanation of the position they are looking for
2. Interviewee's Introduction
    - The interviewee should begin by introducing themselves and highlighting their skills, experience, and achievements
    - You can also mention any relevant projects or experience with the relevant technologies
3. Ask Questions
    - Start the interview with asking questions related to the the interviewers respective job
    - Don't forget to ask follow up questions
4. Share Feedback
    - Once the interview is over, provide constructive feedback on the interviewee's performance
    - Focus on both the strengths and where they can improve
    - Write down a grade for the interviewee for each of the metrics on the rubric if you can

We will be requiring the feedback and grade given by each interviewer. This grade is just for us to have a better idea of where everyone is and will not be used for any kind of grading officially like with QC.
